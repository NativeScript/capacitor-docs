## A Brief Introduction

Yeah yeah, I already know, [take me to the Installation Guide!](installation.md)

## What is NativeScript?

NativeScript enables direct native platform API usage from JavaScript.

The framework provides runtimes for iOS and Android which create a map of each platform API to your TypeScript codebase. Each runtime loads the NativeScript bundle (located in `src/nativescript` within your project) allowing rich platform API development to flourish right from your Ionic web codebase.

The result is less roundtrips to your native platform IDE like Xcode or Android Studio enabling a liberating development experience when needing to enrich your Ionic application with native platform specific behaviors.

## Performance and Stability

Performance is lightning âš¡ fast due to the "real time marshalling" of platform API calls directly from JavaScript.

NativeScript is extremely stable and has been developed and deployed to enterprise production critical applications for well over 6+ years now.
