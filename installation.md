1. Follow the [Ionic Getting Started Guide](https://ionicframework.com/getting-started)

2. Follow the [Capacitor Getting Started Guide](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started)

**NOTE**: This is for Capacitor 3 which is also in beta right now, use `next`:

```
npm install @capacitor/cli@next @capacitor/core@next @capacitor/android@next @capacitor/ios@next
```

3. `npm i @nativescript/capacitor`

4. Enjoy ðŸŽ‰

## Notes

Before installing, ensure you have:

* Followed both the Ionic and Capacitor getting started guides above. Ensure you're using Capacitor 3 beta with:

```
npm install @capacitor/cli@next @capacitor/core@next @capacitor/android@next @capacitor/ios@next
```

* Run `npx cap init` once as mentioned in the Ionic/Capacitor docs.

* Run `npm run build` at least once which generates the output needed to be able to add the Capacitor mobile platforms.

* Run `npx cap add ios` and/or `npx cap add android` to create the Capacitor platforms.

* **You can now install @nativescript/capacitor** successfully.
