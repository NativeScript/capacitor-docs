## Notes

Before installing, ensure you have:

* Run `npx cap init` once as mentioned in the Ionic/Capacitor docs.

* Run `npm run build` at least once which generates the output needed to be able to add the Capacitor mobile platforms.

* Run `npx cap add ios` and/or `npx cap add android` to create the Capacitor platforms.

* **You can now install @nativescript/capacitor** successfully.
