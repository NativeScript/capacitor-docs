## How to Use

Most solutions can be copy/pasted into your own `src/nativescript` files and wired into your app right away. We will try to provide explanations where needed and further instruction if required to use any posted solution.

Feel free to [post your own request on the appropriate proposals](https://github.com/capacitor-community/proposals/issues) for NativeScript solutions you'd like to see here.
