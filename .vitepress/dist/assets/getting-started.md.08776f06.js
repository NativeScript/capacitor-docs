This means you are free to go wild with all sorts of native platform behavior and even make calls with the <code>native</code> object throughout your Ionic application with confidence knowing that the <code>native</code> object is <em>only</em> alive when running on the actual mobile platform. It is simply ignored and deactivated when running your app solely in a web browser outside of Capacitor.</p><h2 id="explaining-the-examples"><a class="header-anchor" href="#explaining-the-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Explaining the examples</h2><p>The installation includes 2 simple examples to give you ideas of possibilities.</p>',11);o.render=function(t,i,o,s,r,c){return e(),a("div",null,[n])};export default o;export{i as __pageData};
