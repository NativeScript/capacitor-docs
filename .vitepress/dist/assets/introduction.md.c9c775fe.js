Each runtime loads the NativeScript bundle (located in <code>src/nativescript</code> within your project) allowing rich platform API development to flourish right from your Ionic web codebase.</p><p>The result is less roundtrips to your native platform IDE like Xcode or Android Studio enabling a liberating development experience when needing to enrich your Ionic application with native platform specific behaviors.</p><h2 id="performance-and-stability"><a class="header-anchor" href="#performance-and-stability" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Performance and Stability</h2><p>Performance is lightning âš¡ fast due to the &quot;real time marshalling&quot; of platform API calls directly from JavaScript.</p><p>NativeScript is extremely stable and has been developed and deployed to enterprise production critical applications for well over 6+ years now.</p>',9);r.render=function(i,a,r,n,l,d){return e(),t("div",null,[o])};export default r;export{a as __pageData};
