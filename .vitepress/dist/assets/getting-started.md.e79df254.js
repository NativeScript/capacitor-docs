It is bundled on it&#39;s own completely separate from your web build allowing it to operate purely as an additive power helper to your web app when running via Capacitor.</p><p><a href="./production-tips.html">Learn more about how to optimize this bundle for production here</a></p>',16);o.render=function(t,i,o,n,s,c){return e(),a("div",null,[r])};export default o;export{i as __pageData};
