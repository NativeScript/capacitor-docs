## Doesn't fit your needs?

No worries, just `npm uninstall @nativescript/capacitor`

We are improving the uninstaller so if you find the uninstall doesn't clean you up enough, feel free to let us know [here](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/issues). During the beta phase we will be improving the uninstaller to be as clean as your mother's kitchen.
