## Doesn't fit your needs?

You can remove NativeScript from Capacitor with:

1. `node ./node_modules/.bin/uninstall-nativescript.js` - will remove ios/android build steps
2. `npm uninstall @nativescript/capacitor` - will remove npm package
3. It is up to you if you'd like to archive the `src/nativescript` folder for later use; It will no longer be used regardless.

If you find the uninstall doesn't clean you up enough, feel free to let us know [here](https://github.com/NativeScript/capacitor/issues).
