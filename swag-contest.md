# Did someone say "Free Swag"?

**Yes!**

For the first 10 developers whom create helpful solutions to any of the [listed Capacitor Community proposals here](https://github.com/capacitor-community/proposals/issues) with this plugin, we will send you:

* 2 sweet bottle openers

* 2 sweet socks

*annnndddd...*

* 2 stress balls!

Once you create a solution, just post a comment on that proposal linking to your solution and send an email to support@nativescript.org with a link to your comment and mailing address and we will send you a sweet goodie bag!
