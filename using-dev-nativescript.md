# Development Workflow

You will find a couple additional npm scripts the plugin added to your project. For example, this one can be used to auto reload the app when making changes within the `src/nativescript` folder:

```shell
"dev:nativescript": "dev-nativescript"
```

You can run `yarn dev:nativescript` when focusing on various NativeScript development efforts for more app live reloading to try changes.
